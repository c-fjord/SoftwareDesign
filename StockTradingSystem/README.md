## Exercise 1:
Considering the GoF Observer pattern, what is/are the subject(s), and what is/are the observer(s) in the stock trading system?
Which variant of GoF Observer is applicable - or would you rather create your own?

The stock should be the subject and the portfolio are the observer.

## Exercise 2:
Design a system in which Stocks may be added to a Portfolio, which should then automatically be notified if
the value of the Stock changes. When this happens, the Portfolio Display should make sure that the stocks
in the portfolio are printed to screen.
Changing stock values could be done from a command line interface, e.g. VESTAS 570.50 or GOOGLE:
943.29.
Create a design document, with a short description of your design and design choices and the class
diagram(s) and sequence diagram(s) you need to explain your design (at least one of each).
